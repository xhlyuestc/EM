Hospital ward call system is one of the important tools and means of hospital modernization management, to improve the medical quality, promote resource sharing and enhance the competitiveness of the hospital has the vital significance. 

Most of the existing hospital ward management system USES a localized management requires human to ward rounds, observation of patients condition, reduce the efficiency of work. As people increasingly attention to health, the increasing of medical behavior lead to the hospital existing system performance declining gradually, the hospital ward management system cannot have satisfied now busy business systems. With the development of network technology brings people more and more depend on network technology is convenient, is the background of this system design. 

This paper first analyzes the language system of the business needs of the hospital ward, the language of the hospital ward system according to the functional division of the four subsystems, and call management subsystem are analyzed in detail the relevant typical business. Then using object-oriented technology to hospital management information system for the architecture design, using the. NET framework to complete the design and implementation of the system. Finally, to make an appointment fee of a typical business function in the process of the system was designed and implemented hospital implementation, function test results show that the relative can well satisfy the needs of hospital's voice calls, and meet the demand of the hospital ward management.
